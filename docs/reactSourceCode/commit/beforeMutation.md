## Foreword

The code for the `before mutation` phase is very short, the whole process is to traversal through the `effectList` and call the `commitBeforeMutationEffects` function to process it.

[You can find the complete source code from here, we have deleted some unrelated logic for better understanding.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1fb18e22ae66fdb1dc127347e169e73948778e5a/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberWorkLoop.new.js#L2104-L2127)

```js
// Save the previous priority, execute at synchronous priority, and restore the previous priority when execution is complete
const previousLanePriority = getCurrentUpdateLanePriority();
setCurrentUpdateLanePriority(SyncLanePriority);

// Mark the current context as CommitContext, as a flag for the commit phase
const prevExecutionContext = executionContext;
executionContext |= CommitContext;

// Handle the focus state
focusedInstanceHandle = prepareForCommit(root.containerInfo);
shouldFireAfterActiveInstanceBlur = false;

// The main function of the beforeMutation phase
commitBeforeMutationEffects(finishedWork);

focusedInstanceHandle = null;
```

We will focus on the main fucntion `commitBeforeMutationEffects` from the `beforeMutation`.

## commitBeforeMutationEffects

We could start talking about it with the code

```js
function commitBeforeMutationEffects() {
  while (nextEffect !== null) {
    const current = nextEffect.alternate;

    if (!shouldFireAfterActiveInstanceBlur && focusedInstanceHandle !== null) {
      // ...focus blur
    }

    const effectTag = nextEffect.effectTag;

    // call getSnapshotBeforeUpdate
    if ((effectTag & Snapshot) !== NoEffect) {
      commitBeforeMutationEffectOnFiber(current, nextEffect);
    }

    // schedule useEffect
    if ((effectTag & Passive) !== NoEffect) {
      if (!rootDoesHavePassiveEffects) {
        rootDoesHavePassiveEffects = true;
        scheduleCallback(NormalSchedulerPriority, () => {
          flushPassiveEffects();
          return null;
        });
      }
    }
    nextEffect = nextEffect.nextEffect;
  }
}
```

We could divide into three parts.

- Deal with the `autoFocus`, `blur` logic after `DOM node` rendered or deleted.
- Call the lefecycle hooks of `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`.
- Schedule `useEffect`.

We will discuss the last two parts.

## Call getSnapshotBeforeUpdate

`commitBeforeMutationEffectOnFiber`, is also known as `commitBeforeMutationLifeCycles`.

[`getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` will be call in the method.](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1fb18e22ae66fdb1dc127347e169e73948778e5a/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactFiberCommitWork.old.js#L222)

Since React v16, the `UNSAFE_ prefix` has been added before the `componentWillXXX` hook.

The reason of it is because after the `Stack Reconciler` is refactored to `Fiber Reconciler`, the tasks in the `render` phase may be interrupted or restarted, and the corresponding component's lifecycle hook (i.e. `componentWillXXX`) in the `render` phase may be triggered multiple times.

This behaviour is different with React v15, so we add `UNSAFE_` to mark it.

For solve this problem, `React` provides the alternative lifecycle hook `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate`.

We can see that `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate` is called in the `before mutation` phase within the `commit` phase, and because the commit phase is `synchronized`, the multiple calls problem will be sloved.

## Schedule `useEffect`

Within these lines of code, the `scheduleCallback` method is provided by the `Scheduler` module to asynchronously schedule a callback function at a certain priority.

```js
// schedule useEffect
if ((effectTag & Passive) !== NoEffect) {
  if (!rootDoesHavePassiveEffects) {
    rootDoesHavePassiveEffects = true;
    scheduleCallback(NormalSchedulerPriority, () => {
      // trigger useEffect
      flushPassiveEffects();
      return null;
    });
  }
}
```

We could find out that the callback function that is dispatched asynchronously is the method `flushPassiveEffects` that triggers `useEffect`.

We will discuss how `useEffects` are dispatched asynchronously rather than synchronously and why they are dispatched asynchronously.

### How to dispatch asynchronously

Inside the `flushPassiveEffects` method, the `effectList` is obtained from the global variable `rootWithPendingPassiveEffects`.

From the previous section, we have talked about `effectList` store the `Fiber node` which need execute the side effect, includes

- Placement
- Update
- Deletion

Except these, the corresponding `Fiber node` of a `FunctionCopoment` will be assign the value `effectTag` when it has `useEffect` or `useLayoutEffect`.

[You can check the effectTag here](https://github.com/facebook/react/blob/1fb18e22ae66fdb1dc127347e169e73948778e5a/packages/react-reconciler/src/ReactHookEffectTags.js)

In the `flushPassiveEffects` method, it traversal through the `rootWithPendingPassiveEffects` (i.e. `effectList`) to execute the `effect` callback function.

If executed directly at this point, `rootWithPendingPassiveEffects === null`.

So when will `rootWithPendingPassiveEffects` be assigned a value?

The code snippet after the `layout` in the previous section will decide whether to assign `rootWithPendingPassiveEffects` based on `rootDoesHavePassiveEffects === true?`

```js
const rootDidHavePassiveEffects = rootDoesHavePassiveEffects;
if (rootDoesHavePassiveEffects) {
  rootDoesHavePassiveEffects = false;
  rootWithPendingPassiveEffects = root;
  pendingPassiveEffectsLanes = lanes;
  pendingPassiveEffectsRenderPriority = renderPriorityLevel;
}
```

So, the whole `useEffect` asynchronous call is divided into three steps

- `before mutation` stage, schedule `flushPassiveEffects` in `scheduleCallback`.
- assign `effectList` to `rootWithPendingPassiveEffects` after `layout`.
- `scheduleCallback` triggers `flushPassiveEffects`, traversal `rootWithPendingPassiveEffects` within `flushPassiveEffects`.

### Why do we need asynchronous

> Unlike `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`, the function passed to `useEffect` fires **after** layout and paint, during a deferred event. This makes it suitable for the many common side effects, like setting up subscriptions and event handlers, because most types of work shouldnâ€™t block the browser from updating the screen.

As you can see, the reason for asynchronous execution of `useEffect` is to prevent synchronous execution from blocking browser rendering.
